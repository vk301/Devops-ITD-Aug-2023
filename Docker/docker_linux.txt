Docker 
	Docker is one of the tools that used the idea of the isolated resources to 
	create a container that allows applications to be packaged with all the 
	dependencies installed and ran wherever we wanted.
	
	Docker can only run on Linux machines this means I cant install Docker directly on Windows or any other OS.
	If I want install Docker on windows then I need to run a Linux VM in windows on top that I need to run Docker.

host machine 
	This is the machine in which docker is running 

Docker images 
	List images 
		docker images 
		docker image ls 

	Delete images 
		docker rmi <image_name>:<tag>	
		docker rmi <image_id>

	Download an image 	
		docker pull <image_id>


	Create upload a image to docker registry 
		1. Connect to the regisrty account 
				docker login 

		2. Have a image with the private registry syntax 
				docker tag <old_image> <username>/<repo_name>:<tag>
				ex: docker tag ubuntu:latest harshajain/test_repo:v1

		3. Push the image to your regisrty 
				docker push <username>/<repo_name>:<tag>	

	Get only images ids 
		docker images -q 

	Delete all the images 
		docker rmi $(docker images -q)
		docker images -q | xargs -I{} docker rmi {}

	To force delete images 
		docker rmi -f <image_id>	
		docker rmi --force <image_id>

	To delete all dangling images 
		docker image prune		


Docker container 
	- A container is a set of isolated processes and its resources in a host machine which is isolated from all the other process. 
	- Docker uses Linux features to achieve isolation by using namespaces, which allows processes to access only resources in that particular namespace, which allows having a process tree means set 
	of processes that is completely independent of the rest of the systems processes and other processes.
	
	Docker definition: A container is a standard unit of software that packages 
	up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably 
	from one computing environment to another.

	List running containers 
		docker ps
		docker container ls	

	List all the containers 
		docker ps -a
	
	List only stopped 
		docker ps --filter "status=exited"

	To stop, start, restart, pause containers 	

		docker stop <container_id1> <container_id2> .... <container_idn>
		docker start <container_id1> <container_id2> .... <container_idn>
		docker restart <container_id1> <container_id2> .... <container_idn>
		docker pause <container_id1> <container_id2> .... <container_idn>

	Delete stopped container 
		docker rm <container_id>

	To stop and delete all the running containers 
		docker rm $(docker stop $(docker ps -q))

	Delete all stopped container 
		docker rm $(docker ps --filter "status=exited" -q)
		docker container prune

	Delete a running container 
		1. Stop the container first 
			docker stop <container_id>
		2. Then delete the container 
			docker rm <container_id>		
			
		smater way:  docker rm $(docker stop <container_id>)
				
	
	Create container from image (Run a container from image)
		docker run -it -d --name <container_name> <image>
			-i - Interactive mode 
			-t - enable tty in the terminal 
			-d - To create container in detached mode (in background)
			--name - To assign a custom name to the container 
			--rm - Using this will automatically deletes the container when it stop/exited 

	To check the resource utilized by all the container 
		docker stats 		
			
	To list all the process running inside a container
		docker top <container_id>

	How to login to a container 
		1. To attach to a container 
			docker attach <container_id>
			(To safely exit: hold ctrl + (QP))

		2. To use exec to create a new shell 
			docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash	


	To check the log of all the output process of container 
		docker logs <container_id>	

Docker custom image / Dockerfile / Docker instructions 
	
	Dockerfile
		Dockerfile is used to create custom images by using any stock image or other image as base image.
		In Dockerfile we can write some set of instructions to update any image.
	
		To create image from Dockerfile
			docker build -t my_ubuntu .
	
	FROM ubuntu
		FROM is the first instruction in the every Dockerfile
		FROM is used to specify the base image on top which all the other 
			instruction will run in the same Dockerfile.
			
		FROM <image_name>:<tag>
		
	RUN 
		Normal shell command or the commands supported by the base image are executed using this instruction.
		we can have n number of RUN in a single Dockerfile.
		
		Normal command format 
			RUN <command>
			
		exec format 
			RUN ['<command>','<param1>','<param2>']	
			RUN ['apt','update']	
			RUN ['apt','install','-y','git']	
			RUN ['ls','-lrt']	

	COPY and ADD 
		Both copy and add instruction is used to copy files and directories from 
		host machine build location to the image and the container created from it.
	
		ADD supports extra source formats 
	  	  - If the source is a compressed file then ADD will automatically uncompress it 
	    		in the destination.
	      - If the source is a downloadable link then ADD will automatically download the 
	        file in the destination.

		COPY <source_path_from_build_context> <destination_inside_image>	  
		ADD <source_path_from_build_context> <destination_inside_image>
